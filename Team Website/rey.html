    <strong>Did you know:</strong>
    <blockquote>
        The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, 
        according to Derek J. de Solla Price.
        It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. 
        It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, 
        between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to approximately c. 100 BC. 
        Devices of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century
