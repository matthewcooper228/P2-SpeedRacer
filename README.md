- Sign In to be able to place bets on matches, view own Past bets
- Sign Up and be given a small amount of credit to work with, complimentary on sign up
- Once they are signed in they start placing bets, if they run out then they can go into debt for x amount of games

------------------
## Functionalities
------------------
- Watch Current Race
    - Displays Entities in the Race
        - Shows Win Loss Ratio
        - Shows Race Progress <b>*</b>
- Check Recent Races (last 5-10)
    - Fixed Number, don't want to give too much information

    - View Statitics
    - View Last Match

## Stretch Goals
------------------

## Racer Premium
------------------
- Obnoxious ads throughout saying how much you get out of premium
- it just lets you choose two to have a safety net

## <b>BACKUP PLAN</b>

- Simon Says? but the board gets bigger slowly
- Solitaire
